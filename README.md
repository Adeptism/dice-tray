# Description

This module implements a dice tray below the chat log, where users can click on die icons and assemble a dice pool. When the roll button is clicked, the dice pool is rolled and a message is generated that shows the results, The message is interacable, where clicking on the individual die results will either counts them towards or ignores them towards the roll result.

This project would not have been possible without the code from the Dice Calculator module: https://gitlab.com/asacolips-projects/foundry-mods/foundry-vtt-dice-calculator/-/blob/master/README.md.
