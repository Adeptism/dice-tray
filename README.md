# Description

This module implements an interactive dice tray below the chat log, where users can click on die icons and assemble a dice pool. When the roll button below the tray is clicked, the dice pool is rolled and a message is rendered on to the chat log that shows the results. The rendered message is interacable, and clicking on the individual die results will either count them towards or ignore them in the displayed roll result.

This project would not have been possible without the code from the Dice Calculator module: https://gitlab.com/asacolips-projects/foundry-mods/foundry-vtt-dice-calculator/-/blob/master/README.md.
